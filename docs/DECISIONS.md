# Decisions

Why RapidRX is the way it is. Read the relevant entry before changing any of these —
each one is here because the obvious alternative was tried, or thought through, and lost.

---

## The product

### ADR-1 · One Flutter codebase — Android is the product
Flutter 3.47 / Dart 3.13, targeting Android, Windows and web. The APK is what a patient uses;
the Windows and web builds exist so a laptop demo shows exactly what the phone shows.

### ADR-3 · Portrait everywhere
`PhoneShell` frames the app as a 412 × 892 phone on anything wider. A second, wide layout would
be designed once and never used.

### ADR-11 · Onboarding order: identity first, then the role, then role-specific
language → voice → phone + code → name → PIN → **role** → a patient's health profile, or a
caretaker's type and pairing code. Health details only make sense for a patient, so the role
comes before them. The old "family member's number" field is gone: the caretaker's own verified
number arrives in their pairing QR code.

### ADR-39 · Ayushman Bharat is a mock behind an interface
The health screen can look up a PM-JAY card, but there is no PM-JAY integration and there must
not be one without the proper agreements. `MockPmjayClient` is deterministic per ID and the card
says **Demo data**; a real client drops in behind `PmjayClient`. Nothing is saved until the
patient says "Yes, this is me". Age is required; height, weight and the card are optional.

### ADR-19 · The patient lands on a menu, not on today's doses
The first thing a new user needs is to add a prescription; what a returning user needs depends on
the time of day. So the app asks. All three tiles fit without scrolling.

### ADR-23 · The merge engine is plain Dart, and never picks a side
This is the step that decides what reaches a patient's schedule. It is deterministic, inspectable
and identical every run, so no model sits between the evidence and the plan. Where sources
disagree, both are kept and a person decides.

### ADR-29 · Four inputs that cross-question each other
Doctor's words, the prescription photo, the printed bill, the chemist. **Identity** is decided
bill > strip > doctor > prescription, because printed text reads at over 99% on the device and
handwriting at about half. **Timing** is decided doctor > prescription > chemist, because the
bill carries none.

### ADR-31 · The medicine card shows the evidence, not a claim
Every source that mentioned a medicine is quoted in its own words. A red card shows each
conflicting reading side by side and cannot be confirmed until a person picks one.

### ADR-36 · The caregiver gets plain text on WhatsApp, not an app to install
Text arrives on any phone, forwards to a doctor, and pastes into SMS for someone with no
smartphone. Medicine names stay in English letters in the Hindi message: the reader may be
holding the strip.

---

## Accessibility

### ADR-2 · Fonts are bundled, never downloaded
Noto Sans and Noto Sans Devanagari ship in `assets/fonts/`. Runtime Google Fonts would render the
Hindi UI as tofu boxes in a hall with no Wi-Fi.

### ADR-4 · The elderly-first scale lives in `ThemeData`
Body text never below 20pt on a patient screen; every tap target at least 64px. In the theme, so
no screen can quietly break it.

### ADR-12 · Localisation is a typed Dart table
`AppStrings` has a getter per string with English and Hindi side by side. A missing translation
is a compile error, not a blank label on a demo phone.

### ADR-15 · The newest screen owns the voice
`VoiceGuide` holds an owner token. A screen stops the voice on its way out only if it still owns
it; a sentence that finishes loading after its screen has gone is dropped. Without this, a user
who moves quickly hears the previous screen talking over the new one.

### ADR-32 · Kokoro TTS, cached per sentence
Device TTS was robotic and often had no Hindi voice. Kokoro (a public Hugging Face Space) sounds
like a person in both languages. Every sentence is cached on the device, so after one warm
walkthrough the voice works offline. Kokoro → device → silence: silence beats a wrong accent
reading the wrong screen. One failure marks the Space unreachable for the session.

## Data and privacy

### ADR-6 · `shared_preferences` now, Firestore for medical data later
This build keeps everything on the phone as JSON. The shapes in `MedicineStore`, `DoseLogStore`
and `VisitRepository` are the documents a Firestore migration would write.

### ADR-14 · Phone, OTP, PIN — all local in this build
The OTP is `1234`, and the screen says so: phone auth needs Firebase's paid plan. The PIN is
stored as a SHA-256 hash, never as itself.

### ADR-20 · A visit is saved after every capture
Not at the end. A phone call or a flat battery mid-visit loses nothing.

### ADR-21 · Consent is a gate, not a checkbox
It is asked before the first capture, in plain words, and nothing is captured on a no.

### ADR-35 · Gemini reads handwriting, and nothing else
The only thing that ever leaves the phone, only after a person presses Read on a card that says
exactly what goes where, and only when online with a key. `gemini-3.8-flash`, temperature 0,
JSON out, four calls per visit, 45 s timeout. Its rows are re-parsed by the same `SigParser` and
land in the same merge: a better reader, not a higher authority.

---

## Extraction

### ADR-25 · The "understanding" step is rules, and says so
Takeaways are produced by `MentionExtractor` + `SigParser`: auditable, instant, no quota, and
nothing invented. The screen says it was read on the phone.

### ADR-27 · Speaking must produce text
Dictation goes through `speech_to_text`. A recording nobody can read cross-checks against
nothing; saving the audio is a separate, optional choice for the family.

### ADR-28 · Photos are read on the device, or the screen says why not
ML Kit on the phone. Everywhere else, `TextRecogniser` returns `unsupported` — never an empty
string, which would be indistinguishable from "your bill was blank".

### ADR-30 · Parser fixes that cross-checking forced out
1. `TELMA 40 TAB` is a strength, not forty tablets: only a single digit or a half can be a count.
2. Bill quantities (`30 NOS`, `1x15`) and prices never land in a name.
3. Double-space columns are cut.
4. `aur` and number words no longer flag clean rows.
5. On a **printed** line, a single digit before `TAB` is a strength (`AMLONG 5 TAB`). Read as a
   count, the line had no strength and no form, and the medicine was dropped from the bill.
6. A sentence that opens with advice ("come back after ten days") is a note, and never attaches
   a duration to the medicine above it.

### ADR-33 · A content gate on every input — that can always be overruled
Strong signals (dosage forms, shorthand, strengths) carry a verdict; weak ones (a word and a
number, a store header) only support one. The words behind a verdict are shown, and every
rejection offers "use it anyway". The bar for speech is lower than for photos.

### ADR-34 · One photo step that reads and labels
Prescription, bill and strips together: find recent, camera, or gallery. Only ticked photos
enter the visit, and only when the step is left. OCR runs once; the text is reused.

---

## Doses and reminders

### ADR-40 · Doctor verification is a checklist, and "not provided" is an answer
Step 2 asks who is verifying. **Doctor** gets one tick per point — name and strength, dose,
timing, food, duration, purpose — each with "Not provided". A row reaches the analysis only when
every point is answered; anything less is an unverified row, left out exactly as an unticked one.
A point marked "not provided" is removed from what the merge sees, so the card shows it missing
rather than guessing it. Verification does not outrank the other sources: a doctor confirming
"morning only" against a prescription reading 1-0-1 is still a red card for a person. **Me** keeps
the tick-and-edit list. A skipped step is recorded on the visit as not provided.

The note for the caretaker (with Low / Medium / High) travels on the prescription record, and a
High note is the first thing on the caretaker's home.

### ADR-41 · Save first, sync later — and nothing late changes a schedule
With no signal, a session is saved on the phone and the person carries on: a banner and one
notification say so, nothing is blocked, and the on-device analysis still gives a result at once.
Work that needs the network — the online handwriting read, the PM-JAY lookup — waits in a
persisted `SyncQueue` and drains in order when the connection returns, retrying with backoff
(15 s doubling, capped at 30 min) and dropping jobs that can never succeed. WhatsApp alerts keep
their own `AlertOutbox` (ADR-36). Anything that arrives after approval is **attached for review**:
a late handwriting reading marks the prescription "new reading to review" and a late PM-JAY card
waits for "yes, this is me". Neither changes the schedule on its own.

### ADR-26 · Two notifications on approval
"Prescription saved" and "Schedule updated" are two different facts.

### ADR-37 · Two reminders per dose, then silence
At the time, and thirty minutes later. By +60 the slot is missed and the **caregiver** is told:
escalation moves to a different person rather than getting louder. Ids come from the slot, so a
re-sync replaces instead of duplicating; every sync is a full replace; confirming a dose cancels
its slot at once. Never for SOS, a finished course, a stopped medicine, or a slot taken.

### ADR-60 · A dose alarm wakes the screen, like an alarm clock
A reminder waiting in the notification shade is easy to miss for the person this app is for. Each
of the two ADR-37 alarms is a **full-screen intent** notification: category *alarm*, on the alarm
audio stream (so "media volume zero" does not silence it), with vibration. `MainActivity` has
`showWhenLocked` and `turnScreenOn`, so the alarm screen opens over the lock screen. Ids, the
two-alarm rule and full-replace syncing are unchanged. The alarms live on a new `dose_alarms`
channel, because Android freezes a channel's sound and importance when it is first created; the
old quiet `dose_reminders` channel is deleted. `USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT` is granted by default to
a sideloaded APK; Android 14+ lets a person turn it off per app (the alarm then arrives as a
heads-up, and tapping it opens the same screen), and a Play Store build would have to justify it.

### ADR-61 · The alarm screen asks one question, and "later" writes nothing
The notification carries only the slot and the day (`dose|morning|2026-09-26`); the medicines are
read from the store when the screen opens, so one stopped after the alarm was set is never shown,
and a slot already taken does not ask again. The screen shows each medicine as the strip looks —
its photo when one exists (`ScheduledMedicine.imagePath`; nothing stores one yet), else its form
as a pictogram — the name in English letters, the dose as dots and the food picture, read aloud.
**Yes, taken** writes the same log as the dose screen and cancels the slot's alarms first.
**No / Later** writes nothing: the dose is still due, and a re-sync keeps the +30 nudge if it is
still ahead — never a third alarm. The whole slot is one answer, because a half-answered alarm
is a question nobody is left to ask.

### ADR-62 · Demo tools are a flag, and a demo never writes
`DevFlags.demoTools` shows a small "Demo" link under the patient menu's tiles: show the alarm now,
or ring it in 15 seconds to watch it wake a locked phone. It uses today's nearest slot with its
real medicines, or `DEMO MEDICINE 500` on an empty schedule, and a demo alarm logs nothing,
cancels nothing and tells nobody: a demo "Yes" at 10am must not mark the night dose taken or
message the family. **Turn the flag off for a store build.**

### Missed is derived, never written
Nothing runs at 09:01 to record a miss. Status is computed day to day whenever it is asked for.

---

## Caretaker pairing

### ADR-45 · Pairing is a QR code and a 4-digit code back — no backend, behind an interface
The caretaker says who they are to the patient (family or a paid, non-family caretaker), then
shows a QR code. It carries versioned JSON — `{v, caretakerId, phone, name, type, issuedAt}` —
as `RXC1.<base64url JSON>.<first 8 hex of SHA-256 over that JSON>`. The same text is the "type
or paste" code for a phone with no camera; the caretaker sends it with **Send the code**. A code
works for 15 minutes, then says so and offers **Make a new code** (same caretaker id, new time).

With no server, the patient's phone cannot tell the caretaker's phone that it scanned. So after
a successful scan the patient's phone shows a **4-digit confirmation code**, derived from the
caretaker id (SHA-256, mod 10 000), and the caretaker types it — both phones compute the same
digits offline, and a match proves the patient scanned *this* caretaker's code. A 4-digit code
cannot carry a name, so the caretaker types the patient's name beside it; the patient's success
screen shows both together.

`PairingChannel` is the seam: `LocalPairingChannel` does the above, and a backend replaces it
(the patient's phone posts the link, the caretaker is told, no code to type). The checksum
catches typos and bad scans; it is **not** a signature — anyone can compute SHA-256 — so a
forged code is possible in this build. A real backend signs codes.

"I'll do this later" is remembered, so a relaunch goes to the caretaker home (which offers the
QR again) instead of trapping them on the QR screen.

---

## The voice agent

### ADR-38 · A keypad, not a conversation — and the last rung, not the first
Designed in [`VOICE_AGENT.md`](VOICE_AGENT.md), not built. A misheard "nahi" logged as *taken*
is the worst failure this product could produce; a keypress cannot be misheard.

---

## Feedback

### ADR-55 · Four haptic words, one switch, and a button that gives
Screens never call `HapticFeedback` directly; they call `Haptics` (`lib/core/feedback/haptics.dart`)
with what happened: **tap** (selection click — a tile, Next, Continue), **confirm** (medium
impact — "All taken", Approve, the right OTP, a recording kept), **error** (heavy impact and a
buzz — a wrong OTP or PIN, a missing field, a recording with nothing in it), **alarm** (three
buzzes). One global `Haptics.enabled` switch silences all of it, for a setting, and a test seam
(`debugOverride`, wrapped by `test/support/fake_haptics.dart`) records calls instead of running
the motor. `Haptics.on(callback)` returns null for a null callback, so a disabled button stays
disabled. Primary buttons are wrapped in `Pressable`, which shrinks to 0.97 under the finger via a
`Listener` (outside the gesture arena, so taps and semantics are untouched) and is exactly 1 at
rest, so no golden moves. Saving shows a spinner in the button at once — never a dead tap.

---

## Records

### ADR-63 · Medical records are one encrypted vault
Medicines, the dose log and the visit draft are one document (`SecureRecordStore`), AES-256-GCM,
a new nonce on every write. The data key is random. On Android it sits in the keystore
(`flutter_secure_storage`). The same key is wrapped with a key from the PIN (PBKDF2-SHA256,
600000 rounds, a random salt stored beside the blob) so a backup can open after a reinstall.
Changing the PIN re-wraps that key; it does not re-encrypt the records. Tests inject a small
round count; the count used is stored in the envelope.

The first launch that finds the old plain preference keys copies them in and deletes them.
Language, voice, role, the PIN hash and pairing stay in `shared_preferences`.

The working copy is an app-private file. A change that actually holds records is mirrored to
`Documents/RapidRX` (`records.vault` and `manifest.json`) through MediaStore on Android 10+,
with no `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`. The manifest is plain and holds only the format version,
times, counts and a hash of the phone number. An empty document writes no backup, so setting a
PIN on a new phone does not look like "previous files".

A wrong PIN loads nothing. A tampered box is rejected. A corrupt file shows an error and the
app continues empty; the file is left where it is. After the splash, and before language, a
check of about five seconds (injectable; a `Timer`, because a real `Future.delayed` never
fires under the test clock) asks before restoring a backup. No leaves the file. Nothing found
offers one demo fixture, rebuilt each time, with Leave demo. The web build has no keystore and
no MediaStore: the blob stays in memory for the tab, and the restore lookup reports nothing
found. IndexedDB would be the same two blobs if a web session must survive a refresh.
